# Lead-Scoring Case Study

## Objective
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines, such as Google. When these people land on the website, they may browse courses, fill out a form for the course, or watch videos. If they provide their email address or phone number by filling out a form, they are classified as a lead. The company also receives leads through past referrals. The sales team then begins making calls and writing emails to these leads, with a typical lead conversion rate of around 30%. Despite acquiring many leads, X Education's conversion rate is low. For example, if they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 will convert. To improve this process, the company aims to identify the most potential leads, also known as 'Hot Leads'. If successful, the conversion rate will increase as the sales team can focus on communicating with potential leads instead of everyone.

To achieve this, you will build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. A higher score means that the lead is hot and more likely to convert, while a lower score means that the lead is cold and less likely to convert. Additionally, there are other problems presented by the company that your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirements change in the future. These problems are provided in a separate document file, and you should include them in your final presentation along with your recommendations.
